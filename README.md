# Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes Classifications

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation and comparison of two popular classification algorithms: **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**. The goal is to demonstrate their functionality, performance, and trade-offs using standard datasets.

## üß† Project Overview

This project aims to:
- Implement **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes** classifiers from scratch and using scikit-learn.
- Compare model accuracy, precision, recall, F1‚Äëscore, and ROC‚ÄëAUC.
- Explore decision boundaries, assumptions, and suitable use cases.
- Create clear visualizations and reporting.

## Algorithms Explained

### Logistic Regression
- A discriminative model used for binary and multiclass classification.
- Outputs probabilities via the logistic (sigmoid) function.
- Estimates model parameters through Maximum Likelihood Estimation, often with regularization (L1, L2).

### Naive Bayes
- A generative model based on Bayes‚Äô theorem with the ‚Äúnaive‚Äù assumption of feature independence.
- Variants include:
  - **GaussianNB** (continuous features)
  - **MultinomialNB** (count data like TF-IDF)
  - **BernoulliNB** (binary features)

## üóÇ Dataset

The starter dataset (e.g., `data/sample.csv`) should include:

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | ... | Label |
|-----------|-----------|-----|-------|
| 0.5       | 1.2       | ... | 0     |
| 1.1       | 0.3       | ... | 1     |

- Ensure no missing values.
- Includes numerical/categorical features and a target column (`label`).
